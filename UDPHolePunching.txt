A is possibly behind T1 and has public IP I1
B is possibly behind T2 and has public IP I2
S is globally known 


Works if NAT xlation of UDP ports is not on a per host basis.

A finds a local source port P1
B finds a local source port P2

A sends UDP message to S containing P1 from P1
S receives a message from I1:Q1 containing P1 

B sends UDP message to S containing P2 from P2
S receives a message from I2:Q2 containing P2 

S sends a UDP message to I2:Q2 containing I1:Q1
S sends a UDP message to I1:Q1 containing I2:Q2

A now sends to I2:Q2 from P1
B now sends to I1:Q1 from P2


On a per host basis: Ouch. No immediate solution.
